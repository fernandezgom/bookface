Bookface, a social networking site for people who love reading, and always have their face in a book. The site allows avid readers to comment on their favourite books, and to read the comments made by others on their favourite books, and other books by their favourite authors. Users can register before they can submit comments on a book. Users can choose a screen name and they should supply an email address. 

The site list authors together with their books. Comments are made on books, not on authors. Users can add authors if they are not already there, and they can add books to authors. The program list their favourite books of a user and is able to see other members of the site who listed those books as being among their favourite books.
